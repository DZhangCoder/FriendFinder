# FriendFinder

### What is FriendFinder? 
Similar to a dating app, FriendFinder is an application that will take in results from users' surveys and then compare their answers with those from other users. The app  will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### How to use FriendFinder? 
On the homepage, click on the button "Go to Survey", and you will be taken to the survey page where you can fill out your basic information and answer a set of 10 questions to determine your compatibility with other users. Note that all fields are required. If you leave any field blank, the app will alert you with a message and stop taking the next step. 

After you fill out all the fields, click on the submit button and the app will display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. See the example screenshot below.

At the bottom of both the homepage and the survey page, there are two links. One is the API Friends List, where you can view all the users' data in the json format. The other one is the link to my github repo.
